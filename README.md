# modalWindow

This application demonstrates working with modal pop-ups using JavaScript and CSS classes. It allows users to open and close a modal window by interacting with various elements such as buttons and the keyboard. <br><br>

The application consists of:
<br><br>

Open Modal: When any button with the class .show-modal is clicked, the modal and its overlay are displayed by removing the hidden class.<br>
Close Modal: The modal can be closed by clicking the close button (.close-modal), clicking on the overlay, or pressing the "Escape" key. The modal and overlay are hidden by adding back the hidden class.<br>
Event Handling: The script ensures that each "Show Modal" button gets its own event listener, and global events like keypresses are handled effectively for closing the modal.
